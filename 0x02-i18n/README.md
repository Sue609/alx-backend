About Babel
Babel is a Python library that provides an integrated collection of utilities that assist with internationalizing and localizing Python applications (in particular web-based applications.)

Details can be found in the HTML files in the docs folder.

Flask-Babel is a Flask extension that adds internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support to any Flask application. Phrase, on the other hand, is a translation management tool that features a powerful in-context editor that makes translating more convenient.
